# Action Plan: Dogecoin Blog Application

---

## Phase 1: Planning and Environment Setup
### 1. Project Analysis and Planning

* [x] **Core Features:**

* An automatically generated blog with short posts about news and Dogecoin price changes.

* A homepage displaying the latest posts.

* [x] **Technology Stack Selection:**

* Backend (application logic): Python (using the Flask framework).

* Frontend: Python will create HTML pages using Jinja2 templates.

* Database: MariaDB (available in Zentyal).

* [x] **Architecture Planning:**

* The Python application will connect to the MariaDB database.

* It will also connect to external services (APIs) to fetch data.

* The user will see an HTML page in their browser generated by Python.

* [x] **Data Source Selection:**

* Price Data: CoinGecko API.

* News/Events Data: NewsAPI.org.

* Content Generation: Google Gemini API language model to create post content based on the collected data.

* [x] Notification Mechanism (SIMPLIFIED): New, generated posts simply appear on the blog's main page as "updates".**

### 2. Zentyal Server Configuration

* [x] **Check Zentyal installation and network configuration.**

* [x] **Create a dedicated system user for the application.**

* [ ] **Configure Web Server Module (Apache):**

* [ ] Create a virtual host for the application's domain.

* [ ] Install and Configure Database Module:

* [ ] Create an empty MariaDB database for the application.

* [ ] Create a database user with a password and grant it permissions to that database.

* [ ] **Configure Firewall Module:**

* [ ] Allow traffic on HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) ports so people can access the site.

* [ ] **Install necessary software on the server:**

* [ ] Install Python.

* [ ] Install pip.

### 3. Development Environment Setup

* [ ] Initialize a Git repository.

* [ ] Create a virtual environment for the Python project (venv) to keep project dependencies isolated from the system.

* [ ] Install initial project dependencies (pip install Flask).

## Phase 2: Backend Development
### 4. Database Design and Implementation

* [ ] Design the database schema (a simple posts table with columns: id, title, content, created_at will suffice).

* [ ] Create data models in the application code (SQLAlchemy) or simple functions to connect to the database.

* [ ] Write a script that creates the table in the database.

### 5. Core Blog Application

* [ ] Implement logic to read posts from the database.

* [ ] Create the main view/page that displays a list of posts.

* [ ] Create a view that displays a single, full post.

### 6. Integration with External Data Sources and AI

* [ ] Write a Python script that fetches data from APIs (price from CoinGecko and news from NewsAPI).

* [ ] Write a function that sends this data to the Gemini API with a request to generate a post.

* [ ] Write the logic that saves the response from the AI to your database as a new post.

### 7. Notification System

* [ ] (This point will be realized by displaying new posts on the main page).

### 8. Task Automation

* [ ] Configure cron on the server â€“ a program that allows for automatic script execution (e.g., every hour) to search for news and create new posts.

## Phase 3: Frontend Development
### 9. Hacker-Style User Interface

* **[ ] Create simple HTML templates using Jinja2 in Python/Flask for:**

* The main page with a list of posts.

* The single post page.

* **[ ] Add CSS styles to give the site a terminal/Matrix look (dark background, green monospace font, text-shadow effects, scanlines, etc.).**

## Phase 4: Deployment and Maintenance
### 10. Deploying the Application on Zentyal Server

* [ ] Configure an application server (Gunicorn) that will act as a "bridge" between the Apache server and the Python application.

* [ ] Configure Apache in Zentyal as a reverse proxy that forwards traffic from the domain to Gunicorn.

* [ ] Secure the connection with an SSL/TLS certificate (Let's Encrypt) to have https://.

* [ ] Configure serving of static files (CSS, images).

### 11. Monitoring and Logging

* [ ] Add simple event logging in the application ("Data fetched", "Post created").

* [ ] Check Apache logs in Zentyal if something is not working.

### 12. Security and Backups

* [ ] Configure regular backups of the database and application code (e.g., via a module in Zentyal).

* [ ] Regularly update Python dependencies (pip install --upgrade package_name).
